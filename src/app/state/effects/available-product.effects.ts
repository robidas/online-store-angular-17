/**
 * AvailableProductEffects
 * 
 * This file contains the effects for the available products.
 * 
 * The loadAvailableProductsEffect$ effect listens for loadAvailableProducts actions,
 * calls the availableProductService.getAll() method when such an action is dispatched,
 * and then dispatches either a loadAvailableProductsSuccess action (if the service call 
 * is successful) or a loadAvailableProductsFailure action (if the service call fails).
 * 
 * NGRX Effects are used to handle side effects in response to dispatched actions. They provide 
 * a way to interact with services and isolate them from the components.
