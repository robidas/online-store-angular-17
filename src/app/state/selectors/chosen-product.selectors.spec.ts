/**
 * Chosen Product Selectors Spec
 * 
 * This file contains the unit tests for the chosen product selectors. It is designed to test the
 * selector's ability to accurately retrieve specific chosen products from the state based on their ID.
 * These tests ensure that the selectors are correctly implemented and can handle various scenarios,
 * such as selecting existing products by ID and handling cases where a product ID does not exist.
