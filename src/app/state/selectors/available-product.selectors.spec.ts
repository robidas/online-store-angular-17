/**
 * AvailableProductSelectors Tests 
 * 
 * This file contains the test suite for selectors related to the available products within the application's state.
 * The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the selectors accurately retrieve and manipulate data from the state,
 * facilitating the retrieval of available product information for components and services throughout the application.
 * 
 * The component being tested, AvailableProductSelectors, provides a set of functions designed to select specific
 * pieces of state from the Redux store. These selectors are crucial for accessing available product data, such as
 * product details, prices, and availability, in a decoupled and maintainable manner. By testing these selectors,
 * we ensure the reliability and integrity of the application's state management concerning available products.
 *
 * While testing selectors, it's important to understand their relationship with reducers and the 
 * overall state configuration. Selectors are designed to be decoupled from reducers, allowing 
 * them to retrieve state information without being directly involved in how that state is updated 
 * or managed.
