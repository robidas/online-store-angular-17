/**
 * TotalsComponent Tests
 * 
 * This file contains unit tests for the TotalsComponent, focusing on its ability
 * to accurately calculate and display the subtotal, tax, and grand total values
 * based on the chosen products in the application. It leverages Angular's testing
 * utilities to simulate interactions with the NgRx store, ensuring that the
 * component behaves as expected when products are added or removed from the state.
