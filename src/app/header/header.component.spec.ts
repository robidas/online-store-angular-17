/**
 * HeaderComponent Tests
 * 
 * This file contains the unit tests for the HeaderComponent. It utilizes the Angular testing utilities
 * to create a testing module and environment for the HeaderComponent. The tests ensure that the component
 * is created successfully and functions as expected. The RouterModule is imported to support any router
 * functionality within the component. These tests verify the component's integration with Angular's router
 * and its standalone capability.
 * 
 * The TestBed.configureTestingModule method is used to configure the testing module by declaring the component
 * under test and importing necessary modules, such as RouterModule. The ComponentFixture is used to create
 * an instance of the HeaderComponent, allowing interaction with the component's template and class during
 * testing. The tests within this file serve as a foundation for ensuring the HeaderComponent's reliability
 * and functionality within the application.
